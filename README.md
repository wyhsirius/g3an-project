# G3AN: Disentangling Appearance and Motion for Video Generation
### [Project Page](https://wyhsirius.github.io/G3AN/) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.05523.pdf)
This is the official PyTorch implementation of the CVPR 2020 paper "G3AN: Disentangling Appearance and Motion for Video Generation"

## Requirements
- Python 3.6
- cuda 9.2
- cudnn 7.1
- PyTorch 1.4+
- scikit-video
- tensorboard
- moviepy
- PyAV

## Dataset
You can download the original UvA-NEMO datest from https://www.uva-nemo.org/ and use https://github.com/1adrianb/face-alignment to crop face regions. We also provide our preprocessed version [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aB7w3d1Ev9Iniui1LTuhLi7zNVK-Wxen/view?usp=sharing).

## Pretrained model
Download the G3AN pretrained model on UvA-NEMO from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sDkWELQHsQqg0MUR-DJsM3YpSyenTX-S/view?usp=sharing).

## Inference
1. For sampling NUM videos and saving them under ./demos/EXP_NAME

```shell script
python demo_random.py --model_path $MODEL_PATH --n $NUM --demo_name $EXP_NAME
```

2. For sampling N appearances with M motions and saving them under ./demos/EXP_NAME
```shell script
python demo_nxm.py --model_path $MODEL_PATH --n_za_test $N --n_zm_test $M --demo_name $EXP_NAME
```

3. For sampling N appearances with different video lengthes (9 different video lengthes) and saving them under ./demos/EXP_NAME
```shell script
python demo_multilength.py --model_path $MODEL_PATH --n_za_test $N --demo_name $EXP_NAME
```

## Training
```shell script
python train.py --data_path $DATASET --exp_name $EXP_NAME
```

## Evaluation
1. Generate 5000 videos for evaluation, save them in $GEN_PATH
```shell script
python generate_videos.py --gen_path $GEN_PATH
```

2. Move into evaluation folder
```shell script
cd evaluation
``` 
Download feature extractor **resnext-101-kinetics.pth** from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zvl89AgFAApbH0At-gMuZSeQB_LpNP-M) to the current folder. Pre-computed UvA_NEMO dataset stats can be found in stats/uva.npz. If you would like to compute it youeself, save all the training videos in $UVA_PATH and run (to obtain 64x64 videos, you need to specify output size when using ffmpeg),
```shell script
python precalc_stats.py --data_path $UVA_PATH
```
To compute FID 
```shell script
python fid.py $GEN_PATH stats/uva_64.npz
```
I have provided npz file for both 64 and 128 resolutions. You can obtain FID around 60 (64x64) and 130 (128x128) by evaluating provided model. Here I improved the original video discriminator by using a (2+1)D ConvNets instead of 3D ConvNets.

## TODOs
- [x] Unconditional Generation
- [x] Evaluation
- [ ] Conditional Generation

Part of the evaluation code is adapted from [evan](https://github.com/raahii/evan). I have moved most of the operations from CPU into GPU to accelerate the computation. We thank authors for their contribution to the community.
